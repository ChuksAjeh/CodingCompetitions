# Google Hash Code Practice
This is simply a repo consisting of all the past years problems that we will be working on in the weeks leading to Google Hash Code 2020.

#### Leaderboards found at:
[Swansea Hash Judge](https://cshashjudge.swan.ac.uk/)

## How to find each years problem
Just go to [Problems](https://github.com/ChuksAjeh/SwanHash/tree/master/Problems) and see the corresponding project folder.

## How to add to work with the repo
1. Create a new branch for some specific functionality being added/ your personal work.
2. Start coding
3. Create a Pull Request to master (**stable states only please**)
4. Merge if deemed fitting

## Google Hashcode 2020 (we placed 7228th):

- Our main problem was we didn't handle books that had already been scanned (this fix meant a greater score but unfortunately we overlooked it during the 3hr45 competition time limit).
- In future (2020 onwards) we will assign:
  * 1 team member to closely look through the datasets to start
  * 1 team member solving the example input by hand (to secure atleast 1 position on the leaderboard)
  * 2 team members to work on the solution using a pair programming technique (***"driver ‚Üî navigator"** approach*).
  
## Reply Code Challenge 2020 (we placed 138th):
#### Search for "The Great Reply" ‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì

- It seems our problem is having inefficient and fragmented code in order to get on to the leaderboards, this becomes problematic once we need to optimise our solution for a greater score, typically meaning we struggle to improve beyond a certain point.
- In future (2020 onwards) we will:
  * All members work on a design approach for first 25 minutes.
  * 1 team member reading input correctly.
  * 2 team members to work on the solution using a pair programming technique (***"driver ‚Üî navigator"** approach*).
  * After first stable submission, begin to work independently implementing all ideas with the most successful one being pushed upstream to this repo as opposed to working entirely locally.
