- Our main problem was we didn't handle books that had already been scanned (this fix meant a greater score but unfortunately we overlooked it during the 3hr45 competition time limit).
- In future (2020 onwards) we will assign:
  * 1 team member to closely look through the datasets to start
  * 1 team member solving the example input by hand (to secure atleast 1 position on the leaderboard)
  * 2 team members to work on the solution using a pair programming technique (***"driver ‚Üî navigator"** approach*).
